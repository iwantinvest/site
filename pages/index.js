          My name is <a href="//www.kopacki.net">Tomasz Kopacki</a>, and I created this site to share whatever I was able to learn about investing money.
          It only seems to be an easy thing, but it's not. You'll see here a lot of my ideas. I will tell you about my best moves, and also about the worst ones!
